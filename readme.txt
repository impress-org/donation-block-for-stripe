== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How is the WordPress Donation Form Block for Stripe different from a GiveWP Donation Form block? =
 
This block contains a single form with a connection to Stripe. It does not have the additional access to PayPal and other payment gateway options, reporting, donor database, or campaign features that the free download of GiveWP provides. If you would like more information about GiveWP, please visit our website.
