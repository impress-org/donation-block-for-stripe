## üë©‚Äçüíª Development Notes

What's up with all the `!important` styles? Well, they're there to make sure the block looks great on all devices. Under the hood, the plugin is using [Aphrodite](https://github.com/Khan/aphrodite) to style the block.

Aphrodite is a CSS preprocessor that makes it easy to write CSS in JS. With WordPress, themes can really adjust the styles of the block in ways that don't really look great. That's why we're aggressively styling it using this tool.
